 üëª ghost Edition  
**Advanced Linux Anonymity Script | VPN > Tor > VPN > Tor Chaining | Dead-Man‚Äôs Switch | MAC & User-Agent Randomizer**

---

 üìñ Overview

**ghost** is an advanced anonymity tool for Linux (Kali recommended). It chains **VPN > Tor > VPN > Tor** connections (as many times as you set), while periodically randomizing your **MAC address**, **User-Agent**, and **hostname** to confuse tracking systems and network admins.

It includes a **Dead-Man‚Äôs Switch** to instantly cut network connections if your VPN drops or your external IP changes.

 ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

 1Ô∏è‚É£ Pre-Run Checks

* Verifies dependencies.
* Detects active network interface.
* Prompts for:

  * User-Agent swap interval.
  * MAC randomization interval.
  * Number of VPN > Tor chains.
  * Dead-Man‚Äôs Switch activation.

---

 2Ô∏è‚É£ Connection Chain

For each loop:

* Connects to VPN via OpenVPN.
* Starts Tor service.
* Randomizes:
  * MAC Address
  * User-Agent
  * Hostname
* Monitors your public IP for changes.
* If Dead-Man‚Äôs Switch triggers:
  * Blocks outbound connections via `iptables`.
  * Kills Tor and VPN.
  * Resets hostname, MAC.
  * Logs the event.
  * Exits cleanly.

---

 3Ô∏è‚É£ Cleanup

On exit (manual or triggered):

* Kills Tor, VPN, and dependent services.
* Restores `/etc/hosts`.
* Resets hostname to `kali`.
* Flushes DNS.
* Re-randomizes MAC one last time.
* Resets `iptables` if Dead-Man‚Äôs Switch triggered.
* Logs all cleanup actions.

 üìù What You Should Add Before Using

**Required Files:**
